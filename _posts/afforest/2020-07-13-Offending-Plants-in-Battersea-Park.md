I was in Battersea Park this weekend and stumbled into some very interesting plants.

## Comfrey

This plant was used as traditional medicines for thousands of years. Originally called "knitbone", it contains Allantonin, which boosts skin sell growth, and rosmarinic acid, which helps relieve pain and inflammation. The broad, furry leaves were ground into a pulp and used to make salves, oinments, and creams to be applied on the skin to help wound healing, muscle strainm arthritis, and gout.

The leaves were sometimes eaten or brewed into a tea to cure diarrhoea, colitis, and stomach ulcers. Research showed that they may be cancerogenic and cause severe liver damage.[1] The safest use for comfrey leaves today is as a fertiliser, as they are full of nitrogen.[2]
