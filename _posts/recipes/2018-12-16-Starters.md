## Focaccia Barese (my version)
### Ingredients
- plain white flour
- any yeast (but ideally Lievito Madre, Beer Yeast or Bread Yeast)
- tomatoes (any type works, but they need to be ripe)
- tomato passata
- extra-virgin olive oil
- oregano
- black olives

### Preparation
Mix warm water, yeast, and a tea spoon of sugar together in a big bowl. Add 500g of flour and knead with some olive oil. Add salt and keep kneading until uniform. The consistency should be soft and sticky. You want it to be too soft to shape into a ball, yet not so soft to be liquid.

Cover the bowl in cling film and let it rest until doubled in size (depending on yeast between 2 and 6 hours). 
Put baking parchment on an oven tray, smear with olive oil and pour the dough. Knead into the shape of the tray, pocking the layer of dough with fingers to create wholes where the excess oil will go. Let it rest for half an hour.

Meanwhile, wash and cut tomatoes in a half. If the tomatoes are quite small, don't separate the halves, but keep them together. 

Spread a fairly thick layer of passata on the focaccia base, leaving an inch of margin. Place the tomatoes, leaving little space between them. Add the black olives in the spaces. Now mix two spoons of oil with three spoons of water in a glass and using the spoon gently pour evenly on the mix. Add oregano and salt.

Place at the bottom of the oven and cook at 180-200 degrees (fan assisted or up and down heaters) until the bottom is a soft brown colour (30-45 minutes). Move up until the top is similarly coloured (~15 mins).

Let it cool. Cut with scissors into squares and burn your tongue with the hot tomatoes.
